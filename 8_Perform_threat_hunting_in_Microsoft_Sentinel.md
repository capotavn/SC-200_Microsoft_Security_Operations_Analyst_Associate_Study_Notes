# SC-200: Perform threat hunting in Microsoft Sentinel

## I. Explain Threat Hunting Concepts

### 1. Understand Cybersecurity Threat Hunts

**Threat Hunting Definition**:
- Proactively hunting through environment for threats or activities not previously detected
- "Not previously detected" differentiates hunting from incident response or alert triage
- Uses KQL queries to find threats

**Types of Hunting**:

**1. Proactive Hunting**:
- Hunt for "not previously detected" threats
- Based on hypothesis, not known indicators
- Focus on attacker tactics and techniques
- Goal: Discover attackers early in attack process before data exfiltration

**2. Indicator-Based Hunting**:
- Search for threats with newly obtained indicators
- Example: New malicious IP from Threat Intelligence Feed
- Search logs to find if indicator seen in past
- Technically not "threat hunting" (using known bad indicators)

**3. Evidence-Based Hunting**:
- Hunt for more evidence from current incident/alert
- Part of incident analysis process
- Explore data based on evidence found in current incident
- Both Sentinel and Defender XDR provide this capability

**Common Element**: All approaches use KQL queries to find threats

**Tool Focus**:
- **Microsoft Defender/Defender for Endpoint**: More focused on indicator and analysis hunting
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: More features to manage threat hunting process

### 2. Proactive Hunts

**Why Proactive Hunting?**:
- Don't wait for threat detection
- Waiting could result in more significant compromise impact
- Discover attackers earlier in attack process
- Prevent data exfiltration

**What to Hunt Without Known Indicators?**:
- Hunt based on **Hypothesis**
- Hypothesis starts with Operational Threat Intelligence
- List attacker tactics and techniques
- Search for specific technique (not indicators like IP addresses)

### 3. Process to Hunt Threats

**Continual Process**:
1. Start with Hypothesis
2. Plan what to hunt for
3. Understand where to hunt and how
4. Know available data, tools, and expertise
5. Execute hunt
6. Respond to anomalies
7. Document everything
8. Perform routine tasks (even if no active threat found)

**Routine Tasks**:
- Set up new monitoring
- Improve detection capabilities

**Documentation Requirements**:
- What, How, and Why
- Input and Output
- How to replicate the hunt
- Next Steps

### 4. Develop a Hypothesis

**Hypothesis Definition**: The idea of what to hunt

**Key Factors for Good Hypothesis**:

**1. Keep It Achievable**:
- Don't hunt where you have no hope of finding results
- Ensure you have available data
- Have sufficient knowledge about threat

**2. Keep Scope Narrow**:
- Avoid broad hypothesis (e.g., "hunt for strange log-ons")
- Define what results could mean
- Be specific

**3. Keep It Time-Bound**:
- Define time period (last day, last week, since log beginning)
- Used in documentation
- Prevents repeating same hunt on same dataset
- Document: "I did this hunt, at this time, covering this period"
- Team members know what period was hunted

**4. Keep It Useful and Efficient**:
- Target threats without adequate detection coverage
- Focus on previously missed threats
- SOC team knows where coverage is good/weak
- Relate to realistic threats
- Don't hunt for threats not applicable to your environment

**5. Keep It Related to Threat Model**:
- Hunt for threats relevant to your organization
- Don't spend time on threats you'll never find
- Align with what you're defending against

**6. Start Simple**:
- Don't start with most advanced threats
- Begin with basics
- Incrementally mature hunting capabilities

**Example Hypotheses**:

**Example 1**:
- Threat Intel: Threat Actor uses automated attacks with cmd.exe process
- Hunt: Find unusual cmd.exe executions

**Example 2**:
- Check for accounts that ran cmd.exe in last day
- BUT did NOT run cmd.exe during past week
- Identifies anomalous behavior

### 5. Explore MITRE ATT&CK

**MITRE ATT&CK Framework**:
- Knowledge base of tactics and techniques
- Observed in global threat landscape
- Used to develop and inform threat-hunting models

**Microsoft Sentinel Integration**:
- Categorize and order queries by tactics
- ATT&CK tactics timeline on Hunting page
- Filter queries by selected tactic

**ATT&CK Tactics** (Enterprise and ICS matrices):

| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reconnaissance** | Find information to plan future operations |
| **Resource Development** | Establish resources (infrastructure, accounts, capabilities) |
| **Initial Access** | Gain entry to network (exploit vulnerabilities, spear-phishing) |
| **Execution** | Run code on target system (PowerShell scripts, download tools) |
| **Persistence** | Maintain access after restarts/credential changes (scheduled tasks) |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Gain higher-level privileges (local admin, root) |
| **Defense Evasion** | Avoid detection (hide code, encrypt, disable security software) |
| **Credential Access** | Steal usernames and credentials for reuse |
| **Discovery** | Obtain information about systems and networks |
| **Lateral Movement** | Move from one system to another (pass-the-hash, RDP abuse) |
| **Collection** | Gather and consolidate targeted information |
| **Command and Control** | Communicate with controlled systems (uncommon ports) |
| **Exfiltration** | Move data from compromised network to attacker network |
| **Impact** | Affect availability (DoS, disk-wiping, data-wiping) |
| **Impair Process Control** | Manipulate, disable, damage physical control processes (ICS) |
| **Inhibit Response Function** | Prevent safety/protection functions from responding (ICS) |
| **None** | Uncategorized |

plt.title('Top 10 Accounts by Login Count')
plt.xlabel('Account')
plt.ylabel('Login Count')
plt.show()
```

**Anomaly Detection Example**:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Prepare data
features = df[['LoginCount', 'UniqueIPs', 'FailedLogins']]

# Train model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
df['anomaly'] = model.fit_predict(features)
