| summarize 
    UniqueUsers = dcount(InitiatingProcessAccountName),
    TotalAccesses = count(),
    Users = make_set(InitiatingProcessAccountName)
| project UniqueUsers, TotalAccesses, Users

Result:
UniqueUsers | TotalAccesses | Users
15          | 250          | ["john@...","alice@...","bob@..."]

Purpose: Monitor access to sensitive data
Action: Too many unique users = oversharing, review permissions
```

```kql
// How many different apps did each user try to access? (password spray)
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where ResultDescription has "Invalid password"
| summarize 
    UniqueApps = dcount(AppDisplayName),
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    TargetedApps = make_set(AppDisplayName)
    by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| where UniqueApps >= 3  // Alert on 3+ different apps
| sort by UniqueApps desc

Result:
User              | IP            | UniqueApps | Attempts | TargetedApps
john@contoso.com  | 203.0.113.5   | 7          | 21       | ["Office365","SharePoint","OneDrive","Teams","PowerBI","Exchange","Azure"]

```kql
// How many different devices did each user log into? (lateral movement)
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventID == 4624  // Successful logon
| summarize 
    UniqueDevices = dcount(Computer),
    LogonCount = count(),
    Devices = make_set(Computer)
    by Account
| where UniqueDevices >= 5  // Alert on 5+ different devices in 1 hour
| sort by UniqueDevices desc

Result:
Account           | UniqueDevices | LogonCount | Devices
admin@contoso.com | 12            | 15         | ["SERVER-DC01","SERVER-DB02","LAPTOP-HR05",...]

Purpose: Detect lateral movement (compromised account)
Action: 12 devices in 1 hour = impossible for normal user → investigate
```

**Use Case 5: Data Exfiltration Detection (Unique Destinations)**
```kql

### **4. count() vs dcount() - CRITICAL DIFFERENCE! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**📌 Most common confusion in exam!**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ FUNCTION    │ WHAT IT COUNTS          │ USE WHEN           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ count()     │ ALL rows (with dups)    │ "total attempts"   │
│ dcount()    │ UNIQUE values only      │ "unique IPs"       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### **Example Comparison:**

```kql
// Sample data: Failed login attempts
IP: 203.0.113.5 (failed login)
IP: 203.0.113.5 (failed login)
IP: 203.0.113.5 (failed login)
IP: 198.51.100.10 (failed login)
IP: 198.51.100.10 (failed login)

// count() - Total attempts (with duplicates)
| summarize TotalAttempts = count()
Result: 5 attempts

// dcount() - Unique IPs only
| summarize UniqueAttackers = dcount(IpAddress)
Result: 2 unique IPs
```

#### **Real-World Scenario:**

**Question:** "How many unique IP addresses accessed your network in the past 24 hours?"

**Wrong Answer:** `count()` ❌  
Result: 50,000 (total connections, not unique IPs)

**Correct Answer:** `dcount()` ✅  
Result: 1,250 unique IP addresses

---

### **5. countif() - Conditional Count ⭐⭐**

**📌 Appears 2+ times in exam!**

#### **Keywords That Mean countif():**
```
✅ "count where..."
✅ "count if..."
✅ "conditional count"
✅ "count [events] that meet [condition]"
```

#### **Key Concept:**
- Counts rows that meet a **condition**
- More flexible than `count()` with `where`

#### **Real-World Use Cases:**

**Use Case 1: Count Multiple Event Types Simultaneously**
```kql
// Track successful, failed, and total login attempts (one query)
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| summarize 
    SuccessfulLogins = countif(ResultType == "0"),
    FailedLogins = countif(ResultType != "0"),
    MFALogins = countif(AuthenticationRequirement == "multiFactorAuthentication"),
    TotalAttempts = count()
    by UserPrincipalName
| extend FailureRate = (FailedLogins * 100.0) / TotalAttempts
| where FailedLogins > 10
| sort by FailureRate desc

Result:
User              | Successful | Failed | MFA | Total | FailureRate
attacker@evil.com | 0          | 127    | 0   | 127   | 100.0%
john@contoso.com  | 2          | 15     | 2   | 17    | 88.2%

Purpose: Comprehensive login analysis in one query
Action: 100% failure rate = pure attack → block IP
```

**Use Case 2: Alert Volume by Severity (Single Query)**
```kql
// Count alerts by severity (all in one query)
SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize 
    HighAlerts = countif(AlertSeverity == "High"),
    MediumAlerts = countif(AlertSeverity == "Medium"),
    LowAlerts = countif(AlertSeverity == "Low"),
    TotalAlerts = count()
| extend 
    HighPercentage = (HighAlerts * 100.0) / TotalAlerts,
    MediumPercentage = (MediumAlerts * 100.0) / TotalAlerts

Result:
HighAlerts | MediumAlerts | LowAlerts | Total | High% | Medium%
150        | 450          | 400       | 1000  | 15%   | 45%

Purpose: Quick security posture assessment
Action: High% > 20% = security issues → investigate
```

**Use Case 3: Malware Detection by Type (Single Query)**
```kql
// Count different malware types simultaneously
DeviceEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where ActionType == "MalwareDetected"
| summarize 
    Ransomware = countif(ThreatType == "Ransomware"),
    Trojan = countif(ThreatType == "Trojan"),
    Spyware = countif(ThreatType == "Spyware"),
    Other = countif(ThreatType !in ("Ransomware", "Trojan", "Spyware")),
    TotalMalware = count()
| extend RansomwarePercentage = (Ransomware * 100.0) / TotalMalware

Result:
Ransomware | Trojan | Spyware | Other | Total | Ransomware%
45         | 30     | 15      | 10    | 100   | 45%

Purpose: Understand malware threat landscape
Action: 45% ransomware = priority threat → enhance ransomware defenses
```

| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where ObjectName == "Processor"
| where CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| summarize 
    AvgCPU = avg(CounterValue),
    MaxCPU = max(CounterValue),
    MinCPU = min(CounterValue)
    by Computer
| where AvgCPU > 80  // Alert on high average
| sort by AvgCPU desc

Result:
Computer      | AvgCPU | MaxCPU | MinCPU
SERVER-DB02   | 85.5%  | 98.0%  | 70.0%

Purpose: Identify overloaded servers

    AvgMemory = avg(CounterValue),
    PeakMemory = max(CounterValue)
    by Computer
| extend MemoryHealth = case(
    AvgMemory > 90, "Critical",
    AvgMemory > 75, "Warning",
    "Healthy"
)
| sort by AvgMemory desc

Purpose: Identify memory-constrained servers
Action: Critical = add RAM or reduce workload
```

---

### **7. max() - Maximum Value ⭐⭐**

**📌 Appears 2+ times in exam!**

#### **Keywords That Mean max():**
```
✅ "maximum"
✅ "highest"
✅ "peak"
✅ "largest"
```

#### **Key Concept:**
- Returns ONLY the maximum **VALUE**
- Does NOT return entire row (use `arg_max()` for that)

#### **Real-World Use Cases:**

**Use Case 1: Peak Memory Usage (Capacity Planning)**
```kql
// What was peak memory usage per server this week?
Perf
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where ObjectName == "Memory"
| where CounterName == "% Committed Bytes In Use"
| summarize 
    PeakMemory = max(CounterValue),
    AvgMemory = avg(CounterValue)
    by Computer
| where PeakMemory > 95  // Alert on peak > 95%
| project Computer, PeakMemory, AvgMemory

Result:
Computer      | PeakMemory | AvgMemory
SERVER-DB02   | 98.5%      | 85.0%

Purpose: Identify servers hitting memory limits
Action: PeakMemory > 95% = add RAM or optimize workload
```

**Use Case 2: Maximum Failed Logon Attempts (Attack Detection)**
```kql
// What was the maximum number of failed logons per user in 1 hour?
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize 
    MaxFailuresPerHour = max(count_) 
    by Account, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| summarize PeakFailures = max(MaxFailuresPerHour) by Account
| where PeakFailures > 50

Purpose: Detect brute force attack spikes
Action: PeakFailures > 50/hour = attack → block source IP
```

---

### **8. stdev() - Standard Deviation ⭐**

**📌 Appears 1 time in exam but important for anomaly detection!**

#### **Keywords That Mean stdev():**
```
✅ "anomaly"
✅ "deviation"
✅ "unusual behavior"
✅ "detect outliers"
✅ "statistical analysis"
```

#### **Real-World Use Cases:**

**Use Case 1: Detect Anomalous Login Patterns**
```kql
// Detect users with abnormal login frequency
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EventID == 4624  // Successful logon
| summarize 
    DailyLogons = count() 
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), Account
| summarize 
    AvgDailyLogons = avg(DailyLogons),
    StdDev = stdev(DailyLogons),
    MaxLogons = max(DailyLogons)
    by Account
| extend AnomalyScore = (MaxLogons - AvgDailyLogons) / StdDev
| where AnomalyScore > 3  // 3+ standard deviations = strong anomaly
| sort by AnomalyScore desc

Result:
Account           | AvgDaily | StdDev | MaxLogons | AnomalyScore
john@contoso.com  | 5.2      | 1.0    | 150       | 144.8 ⚠️

Purpose: Detect compromised accounts (abnormal activity)
Action: AnomalyScore > 3 = investigate (150 logons vs normal 5)
```

**Use Case 2: Anomalous Data Transfer Volume**
```kql
// Detect unusual data exfiltration
CommonSecurityLog
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where DeviceAction == "Allow"
| summarize 
    DailyDataTransfer = sum(SentBytes) 
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), SourceUserName
| summarize 
    AvgDailyTransfer = avg(DailyDataTransfer),
    StdDev = stdev(DailyDataTransfer),
    MaxTransfer = max(DailyDataTransfer)
    by SourceUserName
| extend AnomalyScore = (MaxTransfer - AvgDailyTransfer) / StdDev
| where AnomalyScore > 2
| project SourceUserName, AvgDailyTransfer, MaxTransfer, AnomalyScore

Purpose: Detect data exfiltration (unusual upload volume)
Action: User normally transfers 100MB/day, suddenly 5GB = exfiltration
```

---

### **9. make_set() vs make_list() ⭐⭐**

**📌 Appears 2+ times in exam!**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ FUNCTION       │ WHAT IT CREATES         │ USE WHEN       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ make_set()     │ Array (unique only)     │ "distinct"     │
│ make_list()    │ Array (with duplicates) │ "all values"   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### **Real-World Use Cases:**

**Use Case 1: Unique Applications Accessed (make_set)**
```kql
// What unique apps did each user access?
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where ResultType == "0"  // Successful
| summarize 
    UniqueApps = make_set(AppDisplayName),
    AppCount = dcount(AppDisplayName)
    by UserPrincipalName
| project UserPrincipalName, AppCount, UniqueApps

Result:
User              | AppCount | UniqueApps
john@contoso.com  | 5        | ["Office365","SharePoint","OneDrive","Teams","PowerBI"]

Purpose: Understand user application usage patterns
Action: Excessive apps = overprivileged user → review permissions
```

**Use Case 2: All Login Times Including Duplicates (make_list)**
```kql
// Record all login times for each user (for timeline analysis)
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where UserPrincipalName == "john@contoso.com"
| summarize LoginTimes = make_list(TimeGenerated)
| project LoginTimes

Result:
LoginTimes: ["08:00", "08:05", "08:10", "12:00", "12:00", "16:00"]
                                                  ↑ duplicate preserved

Purpose: Timeline analysis (need all events including duplicates)
```

## ⚙️ QUERY ORDER RULES - CRITICAL! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**📌 Appears 5+ times in exam! KNOW THIS!**

### **Golden Rule: Filter → Aggregate → Visualize**

```
✅ CORRECT ORDER:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Source table                         │
│ 2. where (filter by time)         ←─── FILTER EARLY!
│ 3. where (filter by event type)   ←─── FILTER EARLY!
│ 4. summarize (aggregate/group)    ←─── AGGREGATE AFTER FILTER
│ 5. extend/project (transform)           │
│ 6. render (visualize)             ←─── VISUALIZE LAST!
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Common Mistakes (EXAM TRAPS!):**

#### **❌ TRAP 1: Filter AFTER Summarize**
```kql
❌ WRONG:
SecurityEvent
| summarize count() by Account           ← Aggregates ALL data first (slow!)
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)         ← ERROR: TimeGenerated doesn't exist after summarize
| where EventID == 4625                  ← ERROR: EventID doesn't exist after summarize

✅ CORRECT:
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)         ← Filter FIRST (fast!)
| where EventID == 4625                  ← Filter FIRST (fast!)
| summarize count() by Account           ← Then aggregate small dataset
```

#### **❌ TRAP 2: Render Before Summarize**
```kql
❌ WRONG:
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| render timechart                       ← ERROR: Nothing to render yet!
| summarize count() by bin(...)          ← Too late, render ends query

✅ CORRECT:
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize count() by bin(...)          ← Aggregate first
| render timechart                       ← Then visualize
```

#### **❌ TRAP 3: Where Inside Summarize**
```kql
❌ WRONG (SYNTAX ERROR):
SecurityEvent
| summarize count() where EventID == 4625 by Account   ← Invalid syntax!

✅ CORRECT:
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625                  ← Separate where operator
| summarize count() by Account
```

### **Real-World Complete Query Example:**

```kql
// Detect brute force attacks (correct order)
SigninLogs
// Step 1: Filter time (early filtering = fast)
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)

// Step 2: Filter event type (reduce dataset further)
| where ResultType != "0"  // Failed logins only

// Step 3: Aggregate (count per user)
| summarize 
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    UniqueIPs = dcount(IPAddress),
    UniqueApps = dcount(AppDisplayName)
    by UserPrincipalName

// Step 4: Filter aggregated results
| where FailedAttempts > 10

// Step 5: Add calculated columns
| extend 
    Severity = case(
        FailedAttempts > 50, "Critical",
        FailedAttempts > 25, "High",
        "Medium"
    ),
    DistributedAttack = iff(UniqueIPs > 5, true, false)

// Step 6: Select columns to display
| project 
    UserPrincipalName,
    FailedAttempts,
    UniqueIPs,
    UniqueApps,
    Severity,
    DistributedAttack

// Step 7: Sort results
| sort by FailedAttempts desc
```

10   | max()               | 2+ times  | ⭐⭐
```

### **Study Priority Order:**

**MUST MASTER (100% needed for exam):**
1. ✅ timechart (trend visualization)
2. ✅ arg_max() (most recent events)
3. ✅ Query order (where → summarize → render)
4. ✅ dcount() (unique count)
5. ✅ piechart (proportions)

**SHOULD KNOW (80% coverage):**
6. ✅ barchart (compare categories)
7. ✅ countif() (conditional count)
8. ✅ arg_min() (earliest events)
9. ✅ bin() (time intervals)
10. ✅ make_set() (unique arrays)

**NICE TO HAVE (20% coverage):**
11. ✅ stdev() (anomaly detection)
12. ✅ scatterchart (correlation)
13. ✅ make_list() (all values array)

## 🚨 COMMON TRAPS & HOW TO AVOID

### **Trap 1: Confusing arg_max() vs max()**

```
Question: "Identify the most recent login event for each user"

❌ WRONG ANSWER: max()
Reason: max() returns ONLY the timestamp (no other details)
Result: User, MaxTime (missing IP, location, etc.)

✅ CORRECT ANSWER: arg_max()
Reason: arg_max() returns ENTIRE ROW with all details
Result: User, Time, IP, Location, App, etc.

REMEMBER: Need event DETAILS? → arg_max() or arg_min()
          Need only VALUE? → max() or min()
```

### **Trap 2: Confusing count() vs dcount()**

```
Question: "How many unique IP addresses accessed your network?"

❌ WRONG ANSWER: count()
Reason: count() counts ALL rows (with duplicates)
Result: 50,000 total connections

✅ CORRECT ANSWER: dcount()
Reason: dcount() counts UNIQUE IPs only
Result: 1,250 unique IP addresses

REMEMBER: "unique" / "distinct" → dcount()
          "total" / "all" → count()
```

### **Trap 3: Wrong Query Order**

```
❌ WRONG: summarize before where
SecurityEvent
| summarize count() by Account
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)  ← ERROR! Column doesn't exist

✅ CORRECT: where before summarize
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)  ← Filter first
| summarize count() by Account    ← Then aggregate

REMEMBER: Filter (where) ALWAYS before Aggregate (summarize)
```

### **Trap 4: Where Inside Summarize (Syntax Error)**

```
❌ WRONG SYNTAX:
| summarize count() where EventID == 4625 by Account

✅ CORRECT SYNTAX:
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize count() by Account

REMEMBER: where is a SEPARATE operator, not inside summarize
```

### **Trap 5: Render Before Aggregate**

```
❌ WRONG ORDER:
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| render timechart               ← ERROR! Nothing to render
| summarize count() by bin(...)  ← Too late

✅ CORRECT ORDER:
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize count() by bin(...)  ← Aggregate first
| render timechart               ← Then visualize

REMEMBER: render is ALWAYS the LAST operator
```

### **Trap 6: Forgetting bin() for Time Aggregation**

```
❌ WRONG: No bin() with time aggregation
| summarize count() by TimeGenerated
Result: 86,400 rows (one per second) - Too detailed!

✅ CORRECT: Use bin() to group time intervals
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
Result: 24 rows (one per hour) - Perfect!

REMEMBER: Always use bin() when aggregating by time
```

SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize 
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    UniqueIPs = dcount(IpAddress)
    by Account
| where FailedAttempts > 10
```

### **Pattern 2: Monitor Trends Over Time**

```kql
// Template: Track metric over time
[Table]
| where TimeGenerated > ago([TimeWindow])
| where [FilterCondition]
| summarize [Metric] = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, [Interval])
| render timechart

// Example 1: Failed logons trend
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize FailedLogons = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| render timechart

// Example 2: Malware detections trend
DeviceEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ActionType == "MalwareDetected"
| summarize Detections = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| render timechart

// Example 3: Alert volume trend
SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize AlertCount = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| render timechart
```

### **Pattern 3: Find Most Recent Event Per Entity**

```kql
// Template: Get last event for each entity
[Table]
| where TimeGenerated > ago([TimeWindow])
| where [FilterCondition]
| summarize LastEvent = arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by [EntityColumn]
| project [Columns...]

// Example 1: Last login per user
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d)
| where ResultType == "0"
| summarize LastLogin = arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by UserPrincipalName
| where TimeGenerated < ago(30d)  // Not logged in 30+ days
| project UserPrincipalName, LastLogin = TimeGenerated, IPAddress, Location

// Example 2: Last malware detection per device
DeviceEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where ActionType == "MalwareDetected"
| summarize LastMalware = arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceName
| project DeviceName, LastDetection = Timestamp, ThreatName = FileName

// Example 3: Last security alert per resource
SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize LastAlert = arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by ResourceId
| project ResourceId, LastAlert = TimeGenerated, AlertName, Severity
```

### **Pattern 4: Compare Categories (Top N)**

```kql
// Template: Compare entities by metric
[Table]
| where TimeGenerated > ago([TimeWindow])
| where [FilterCondition]
| summarize [Metric] = count() by [Category]
| top [N] by [Metric] desc
| render barchart

// Example 1: Top 10 users by failed logons
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize FailedLogons = count() by Account
| top 10 by FailedLogons desc
| render barchart

// Example 2: Top departments by incidents
SecurityIncident
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| extend Department = tostring(parse_json(AdditionalData).Department)
| summarize IncidentCount = count() by Department
| sort by IncidentCount desc
| render barchart

// Example 3: Top source countries by attacks
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where ResultType != "0"
| summarize Attacks = count() by Location
| top 10 by Attacks desc
| render barchart
```

### **Pattern 5: Detect Anomalies (Statistical)**

```kql
// Template: Find outliers using standard deviation
[Table]
| where TimeGenerated > ago([LongTimeWindow])
| where [FilterCondition]
| summarize [DailyMetric] = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), [Entity]
| summarize 
    AvgDaily = avg([DailyMetric]),
    StdDev = stdev([DailyMetric]),
    MaxValue = max([DailyMetric])
    by [Entity]
| extend AnomalyScore = (MaxValue - AvgDaily) / StdDev
| where AnomalyScore > [Threshold]
| sort by AnomalyScore desc

// Example: Detect abnormal login patterns
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EventID == 4624
| summarize DailyLogons = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), Account
| summarize 
    AvgDaily = avg(DailyLogons),
    StdDev = stdev(DailyLogons),
    MaxLogons = max(DailyLogons)
    by Account
| extend AnomalyScore = (MaxLogons - AvgDaily) / StdDev
| where AnomalyScore > 3  // 3+ std deviations = strong anomaly
| project Account, AvgDaily, MaxLogons, AnomalyScore
```

### **Pattern 6: Password Spray Detection**

```kql
// Template: Detect same password tried across multiple apps/accounts
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago([TimeWindow])
| where ResultDescription has 'Invalid password'
| summarize 
    UniqueTargets = dcount([TargetColumn]),
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    Targets = make_set([TargetColumn])
    by [AttackerColumn], [SourceIPColumn]
| where UniqueTargets >= [Threshold]
| sort by UniqueTargets desc

// Example 1: Detect password spray (across apps)
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where ResultDescription has 'Invalid password'
| summarize 
    UniqueApps = dcount(AppDisplayName),
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    TargetedApps = make_set(AppDisplayName)
    by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| where UniqueApps >= 3
| sort by UniqueApps desc

// Example 2: Detect password spray (across users)
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where ResultDescription has 'Invalid password'
| summarize 
    UniqueUsers = dcount(UserPrincipalName),
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    TargetedUsers = make_set(UserPrincipalName)
    by IPAddress
| where UniqueUsers >= 10
| sort by UniqueUsers desc
```

## 🎯 FINAL EXAM CHECKLIST

### **Before Exam Day:**

**KQL Concepts (Must Know):**
- [ ] timechart for time trends (8+ questions)
- [ ] arg_max() for most recent events (6+ questions)
- [ ] Query order: where → summarize → render (5+ questions)
- [ ] dcount() for unique counts (5+ questions)
- [ ] piechart for proportions (4+ questions)
- [ ] barchart for comparisons (3+ questions)
- [ ] countif() for conditional counts (2+ questions)
- [ ] arg_min() for earliest events (2+ questions)
- [ ] bin() for time intervals (always with summarize)
- [ ] make_set() for unique arrays

**Common Traps (Must Avoid):**
- [ ] Don't confuse arg_max() vs max()
- [ ] Don't confuse dcount() vs count()
- [ ] Never put where after summarize
- [ ] Never put where inside summarize
- [ ] Never put render before summarize
- [ ] Always use bin() with time aggregation

**Real-World Scenarios (Practice):**
- [ ] Brute force detection queries
- [ ] Trend monitoring (timechart)
- [ ] Most recent event queries (arg_max)
- [ ] Unique count queries (dcount)
- [ ] Comparison queries (barchart)
- [ ] Anomaly detection (stdev)
