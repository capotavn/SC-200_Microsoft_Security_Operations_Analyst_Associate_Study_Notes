# 9. Mitigate Threats Using Microsoft Purview

## I. Investigate and Respond to Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention Alerts

### Understanding DLP Alerts

**What is a DLP Alert?**
- Notifications triggered when actions match DLP policy conditions
- Can be single-event (e.g., emailing sensitive document to personal account) or aggregate (multiple small events accumulating over time)
- Alerts don't automatically indicate malicious activityâ€”require investigation to determine if action is needed or policy needs tuning

**Where DLP Alerts Appear**
- **Microsoft Defender XDR**: For security investigations, consolidates incidents to connect multiple threat signals
- **Microsoft Purview**: For compliance focus on policy details, rules, and policy tuning

### DLP Alert Lifecycle

**1. Trigger**
- Alert starts when user action matches DLP policy condition
- Examples: Sharing sensitive data externally, downloading confidential files to removable media, uploading protected content to unsanctioned apps

**2. Notify**
- Alerts appear in Microsoft Defender portal and Microsoft Purview alerts dashboard
- Email notifications sent to admins/security teams based on policy setup
- Activity explorer provides detailed event information

**3. Triage**
- Review alerts to determine false positives or valid incidents
- Assign priority levels and designate response owners
- Defender portal groups related alerts into incidents for broader context
- Can use tags, comments, and filters to manage alert queue
- Filter by Service source: Data Loss Prevention to focus on DLP alerts
- Microsoft Security Copilot can analyze alert context and suggest next steps

**4. Investigate**
- Gather evidence and review activity logs
- **Investigation Tools**:
  - Microsoft Defender portal: View incidents, correlate alerts, tag users
  - Microsoft Purview alerts dashboard: Review alert context, update status
  - Activity explorer: Filter and view user actions
  - Content explorer: Deep review of triggering files/content
  - User activity summary: Up to 120 days of user behavior

**5. Remediate**
- Actions include: Mark as informational, follow up with user, block file sharing, revoke access, remove files, apply sensitivity labels, reset passwords, disable accounts, isolate devices
- Defender portal allows direct actions: Remove/quarantine files, revoke permissions, disable accounts, reset passwords, download/delete emails

**6. Tune**
- Adjust policy based on outcomes
- Consider: Sensitivity level of conditions, policy scope, notification settings, whether low-risk actions should trigger alerts
- Reduces false positives and improves detection over time

### Configuring DLP Policies to Generate Alerts

**Alert Types**
- **Single-event alerts**: Generated every time policy rule matches (for low-volume, high-sensitivity events)
- **Aggregate-event alerts**: Generated only when threshold met (e.g., 10 matches in 24 hours) to reduce alert fatigue

**Licensing Requirements**
- Single-event alerts: E1, F1, G1, E3, or G3 licenses
- Aggregate-event alerts: E5 license or add-ons (Office 365 ATP Plan 2, Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance, eDiscovery and Audit add-on)
- Aggregation window: 1-minute (E5/add-on) or 15-minute (E3/G3 without add-on)

**Required Roles**
- Compliance Administrator, Information Protection Admin, Security Operator, Security Reader, Information Protection Investigator
- Manage alerts role for DLP alert management dashboard

**Alert Behavior**
- Alerts trigger once per document even if shared/accessed multiple times
- Can take up to 3 hours for new/updated policy to generate alerts
- Endpoint DLP and Teams DLP alerts also appear in DLP alerts dashboard

## II. Investigate Insider Risk Alerts and Related Activity

### Understanding Insider Risk Alerts

**Alert Generation Process**
1. **Settings configured**: Configure risk indicators, sensitive domains, privacy preferences
2. **Policy created**: Define whose activity to evaluate, what to detect, triggering events
3. **Triggering event occurs**: Activates policy for specific user (e.g., resignation date set, risky website accessed, exfiltration behavior detected)
4. **User activity evaluated and scored**: Activities assigned risk scores based on type, thresholds, user history
5. **Alert generated**: When user's risk score exceeds policy-defined threshold

**Why Alert Generation Matters**
- Helps identify what triggered alert
- Understand which activities were evaluated
- Determine appropriate next steps
- Align alert evaluation with policy criteria

### Managing Alert Volume

**When Receiving Too Few Alerts**
- Enable more risk indicators in Policy indicators settings
- Include more users in policy scope
- Lower trigger thresholds for earlier evaluation
- Lower indicator thresholds for less severe activity
- Adjust alert volume slider toward "More alerts"

**When Receiving Too Many Alerts**
- Enable analytics to identify high-risk areas
- Use real-time insights to update thresholds
- Refine policy scope and content (narrow user list, prioritize sensitive files)
- Enable inline alert customization for analyst threshold adjustments
- Dismiss multiple low-priority alerts in bulk

**Configuration Options**
- Use appropriate policy templates for specific risk scenarios
- Configure global exclusions to prevent benign activity alerts
- Define detection groups for different user populations
- Create indicator variants to refine detection logic
- Adjust policy timeframes for activity evaluation scope
