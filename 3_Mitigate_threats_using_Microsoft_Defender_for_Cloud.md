# SC-200: Mitigate threats using Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## I. Plan for Cloud Workload Protections

### 1. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Overview

**Two Broad Pillars of Cloud Security**:

**Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**:
- **Visibility**: Understand current security situation
- **Hardening Guidance**: Efficiently improve security
- **Secure Score**: Central feature - single score aggregating all findings (higher score = lower risk)

**Cloud Workload Protection (CWP)**:
- Security alerts powered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence
- Advanced, intelligent protections for workloads
- Microsoft Defender enhanced security features plans for specific resource types

### 2. Defender for Cloud Capabilities

**Core Functions**:

## II. Connect Azure Assets to Defender for Cloud

### 1. Asset Inventory

**Purpose**: Single page view of security posture for connected resources

**Key Features**:

**Summaries**:
- **Total Resources**: All resources connected to Defender for Cloud
- **Unhealthy Resources**: Resources with active security recommendations
- **Unmonitored Resources**: Resources with agent monitoring issues (Log Analytics agent not sending data or has health issues)

**Filters**: Refine resource list by criteria
- Example queries: "Which Production machines are missing Log Analytics agent?", "How many machines with specific tag have outstanding recommendations?"

**Export Options**:
- Export to CSV file
- Export query to Azure Resource Graph Explorer
- Further refine with KQL query

**Asset Management Options**:
- **Tag Assignment**: Bulk tag filtered resources
- **Onboard Servers**: Add non-Azure servers
- **Automate Workloads**: Trigger Logic Apps on resources (requires pre-prepared Logic Apps with HTTP request trigger)

**How It Works**:
- Utilizes Azure Resource Graph (ARG)
- Query security posture data across multiple subscriptions
- Uses Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Cross-reference data for deep insights

**Using Asset Inventory**:
1. Navigate: Defender for Cloud → Inventory
2. Use "Filter by name" box for specific resource
3. Select filter options to create query
4. **Security findings filter**: Enter ID, security check, or CVE name
5. **Defender for Cloud filter**:
   - **Off**: Not protected by Defender plan (can right-click to upgrade)
   - **On**: Protected by Defender plan
   - **Partial**: Subscription with some plans disabled

### 2. Configure Auto Provisioning

**Purpose**: Collect data from VMs, scale sets, IaaS containers, non-Azure machines for security monitoring

**Data Collection Requirements**:
- Monitor security vulnerabilities and threats
- Identify missing updates, misconfigured OS settings
- Endpoint protection status monitoring
- Health and threat protection

**Supported Agents and Extensions**:

**Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** - Recommended:
- Collects security configurations and event logs
- Copies data to workspace for analysis

**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**:
- Advanced threat protection capabilities
- Endpoint detection and response

**Log Analytics Agent**:
- Officially retired (August 2024)
- No longer supported
- Migrate to Azure Monitor Agent

**Security Extensions**:
- Azure Policy Add-on for Kubernetes
- Provides data for specialized resource types

**Why Use Auto Provisioning**:
- Reduces management overhead
- Installs required agents and extensions on existing and new machines
- Ensures faster security coverage for all supported resources

**How Auto Provisioning Works**:
- Toggle for each supported extension type
- Enabling auto provisioning assigns "Deploy if not exists" policy
- Extension provisioned on all existing and future resources

### 3. Enable Defender for Endpoint Integration

**Default Behavior**:
- Enabled by default when Defender for Servers plan enabled
- Can be toggled OFF if needed

**Enable Integration**:
1. Navigate: Environment settings → Select subscription
2. Settings and monitoring → Endpoint protection
3. Toggle Status to ON
4. Select Continue → Save

**Deployment**:
- Defender for Endpoint sensor deployed to all Windows and Linux machines
- Onboarding may take up to 1 hour
- Detects previous installations and reconfigures for integration

**Note**: Azure VMs from generalized OS images - MDE not auto-provisioned (manual enable via Azure CLI, REST API, or Azure Policy)

### 4. Direct Onboarding with Defender for Endpoint

**Purpose**: Connect non-Azure servers (on-premises and multicloud) without Azure Arc

**How It Works**:
- Non-Azure servers onboarded to Defender for Endpoint automatically appear in Defender for Cloud
- Shown under designated Azure subscription
- Provides licensing, billing, alerts, security insights through Azure subscription
- Integrates vulnerability data and software inventory

**Important Note**: Does NOT provide server management capabilities (Azure Policy, Extensions, Guest configuration)

**Enable Direct Onboarding**:
1. Navigate: Environment Settings → Direct onboarding
2. Toggle Direct onboarding to ON
3. Select subscription for directly onboarded servers
4. Save
5. Wait up to 24 hours for servers to appear

**Deploy Defender for Endpoint**:
- Use standard Defender for Endpoint onboarding process
- Deploy agent on on-premises Windows and Linux servers
- Same deployment method regardless of direct onboarding

**Limitations**:
- **Plan Support**: Access to all Defender for Servers Plan 1 features; Plan 2 features may require Azure Arc
- **Multicloud Support**: Can onboard AWS/GCP VMs, but Azure Arc recommended for multicloud connectors
- **Agent Versions**: Minimum version requirements must be met

### 5. Microsoft Sentinel Integration

**Important Considerations**:
- Security events collection cannot be configured from both Defender for Cloud and Sentinel simultaneously
- Two options if adding Sentinel to workspace already using Defender for Cloud:

**Option 1**: Leave Security Events collection in Defender for Cloud
- Query and analyze events in both Sentinel and Defender for Cloud
- Cannot monitor connector connectivity status in Sentinel
- Cannot change configuration in Sentinel

**Option 2**: Disable Security Events in Defender for Cloud
- Set Windows security events to "None" in Log Analytics agent
- Add Security Events connector in Sentinel
- Query and analyze in both products
- Monitor connector connectivity status only in Sentinel
- Change configuration only in Sentinel

**Event Types**:

**Common Set**:
- Full user audit trail
- User logins and sign-outs (event ID 4634)
- Security group changes
- Key domain controller Kerberos operations
- Industry-recommended events
- Designed to reduce volume while maintaining audit capability

**Minimal Set**:
- Events indicating successful breach
- Important events with low volume
- User successful/failed logins (event IDs 4624, 4625)
- Process creation event (event ID 4688)
- Does NOT contain sign-outs (high volume, less meaningful for detection)

| **Medium** | Probably suspicious activity, might indicate compromise | Medium confidence in analytic/finding, medium to high confidence of malicious intent (ML or anomaly-based detections) |
| **Low** | Might be benign positive or blocked attack | Not confident intent is malicious, activity might be innocent (e.g., log clear) |
| **Informational** | Only visible when drilling into security incident or via REST API | Context-dependent, worthy of closer look within incident |

### 4. MITRE ATT&CK Tactics
